= Stella - 0.7 PREVIEW

<b>Blame Stella for breaking your web applications.</b>

== Features

* Realistic load simulation
* Sophisticated response handling (with automatic HTML document parsing)
* Dynamic variable replacement 


== PREVIEW NOTICE

This is an early preview of Stella. The following features are still under development (as of 2009-09-15):

* Reporting of any kind. 
* File uploads.
* Documentation.


== Usage Example

    # Verify a test plan is defined correctly
    # by running a single user functional test.
    $ stella verify -p examples/basic/plan.rb http://stellaaahhhh.com/
    
    # Generate load using the same test plan. 
    $ stella generate -p examples/basic/plan.rb -c 50 http://stellaaahhhh.com/
    
    
== Test Plan Example


Test plans are defined in the Ruby programming language. This makes it possible to define sophisticated logic to handle responses. They also typically contain more than one usecase which is important when simulating realistic load. In this example, 65% of virtual users will execute the first usecase and 35% will execute the second.

    usecase 65, "Simple search" do
  
      get "/", "Homepage" do
        wait 1..5
        response 200 do
          status                       # => 200
          headers['Content-Type']      # => ['text/html']
          body                         # => <html>...
          doc                          # => Nokigiri::HTML::Document
        end
      end
  
      get "/search", "Search Results" do
        wait 2..5
        param :what  => 'Sarsaparilla'
        param :where => 'Lexington'
        response 200 do
          listing = doc.css('div.listing').first
          set :lid, listing['id'].match(/(\d+)/)[0]
        end
      end
      
      get "/listing/:lid" do           # URIs can contain variables.
        desc "Selected listing"        # This one will be replaced by
        wait 1..8                      # the one stored in the previous
      end                              # request.
  
    end

    usecase 35, "YAML API" do
    
      resource :listing_ids, list('ids.csv')
      
      get "/listing/:lid.yaml" do
        desc "Select listing"
        param :lid => random(:listing_ids)
        response 200 do
          repeat 5
        end
      end

    end
